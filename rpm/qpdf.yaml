Description: |
    QPDF is a command-line tool and C++ library that performs
    content-preserving transformations on PDF files. It supports
    linearization, encryption, and numerous other features. It can also
    be used for splitting and merging files, creating PDF files (but you
    have to supply all the content yourself), and inspecting files for
    study or analysis. QPDF does not render PDFs or perform text
    extraction, and it does not contain higher-level interfaces for
    working with page contents. It is a low-level tool for working with
    the structure of PDF files and can be a valuable tool for anyone who
    wants to do programmatic or command-line-based manipulation of PDF
    files.
